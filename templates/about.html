                <h3>👑 Our Founder's Journey</h3>
                <p>Kumudhini Silks is a self-built brand born from the vision and perseverance of Mrs. Kumudhini V., who began her journey as a young girl supporting her family by selling sarees after school. Each saree she sold carried her dedication, each customer her growing confidence.</p>
                
                <p>What began as a modest livelihood has flourished into one of Bengaluru's leading saree destinations, known for authenticity, artistry, and trust.</p>
                
                <p>For over 35 years, Kumudhini Silks has remained rooted in the values of hard work, honesty, and heritage - creating a brand that celebrates women's strength and South Indian craftsmanship.</p>
                
                <p>Today, Kumudhini Silks is more than a name; it is a legacy woven from the threads of resilience and refinement. Our founder's belief that "true beauty lies in authenticity" continues to inspire every collection we curate.</p>
                
                <p>Each saree in our store - whether a royal Kancheepuram or a delicate tissue weave - carries the same spirit that started it all: pure, graceful, and enduring.</p>
